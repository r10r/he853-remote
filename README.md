# About

The he853-remote project provides a library and CLI programm for the
[homeeasy he853 433.92MHz USB RF remote control sender](http://www.elro.eu/en/products/category/home_automation/home_easy/zenders2/pc_afstandsbediening_usb_dongle).
The sender is used for toggling RF controlled power sockets.

The library was is extracted from [roseasy](http://ros.org/wiki/roseasy)
which is a part of the [ROS (Robot Operating System)](http://www.ros.org/wiki/) project.

Another project that provides a C# Windows SDK for the dongle is
the [HE853 Control Project](http://he853control.sourceforge.net/).

## Usage

You can build the CLI programm by simply running

  make

You have to be root to execute the program.

  ./he853 <deviceId> <command>

The command is either a *0* for *OFF* or anything > 0 for *ON*.
To program the power socket you have to place the power socket into learning
mode and send the *ON* command to it:

  ./he853 2001 1

After that you can use the deviceId *2001* for toggling the power socket.

### Requirements

* libusb development headers (debian: *libusb-1.0-0-dev*)

### How to run without root

* Copy the `80-he853.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
* Add a 'he-dongle' group (using groupadd or edit the /etc/group file)
* Add users to the group
* Reload the udev rules with `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
* Unplug and replug the device

### Known Issues

* doesn't compile on OSX
